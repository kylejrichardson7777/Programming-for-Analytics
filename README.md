In this project I will be analzying a dataset of Dungeons and Dragons character sheets from DndBeyond, the offical online interface for the game. Dungeons and Dragons(D&D) is a popular tabletop roleplaying game that boasts millions of players globaly.
I found this dataset on kaggle.
In D&D, each player has a character sheet which tracks the mechanics and logistics of their character. 
This sheet is either kept in paper or stored on digital services like DndBeyond. The dataset I'm working with here is from their website and contains over 1.2 million unique character sheets. Analysing this data is incredibly useful for discovering trends between players, and uncovering what are the most popular aspects of the game and other details that could drive marketing or product development.

My research question is: Every playgroup plays D&D in their own unique way. By analyzing the types of characters players'create, can we identify popular styles of play that could be catered to with future D&D products.
